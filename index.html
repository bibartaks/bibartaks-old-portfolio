            <p>
              Hi there! I'm Bibarta, a 14-year-old front-end developer. Starting
              at age 10 as a self-taught programmer, I quickly captured my
              father's attention, who enrolled me in a prestigious online
              platform for learning code. Later Scholarships from various
              worldleading developer platforms soon followed. My mother often
              says I had a keen interest in drawing & playing games. And so, she
              bought me a tablet to fuel my artistic spirit. Now, as a front-end
              developer, I enjoy combining artistic flair with technical
              expertise to create captivating and user-friendly interfaces. With
              the latest web technologies and a dedication to staying up-to-date
              with the ever-evolving industry trends, I can ensure my work
              remains at the forefront of innovation. Everyday I've been honing
              my skills and learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and other
              frameworks. Recently I've successfully completed another advanced
              frontend development course under Scrimba. I'm seeking a full-time
              role where I can help a company achieve their goals. Beyond
              coding, Cricket has been a cherished pastime for me since an early
              age. As a valuable team member, I have actively participated in
              various age-based domestic district cricket tournaments.
              Additionally, my love for animals shines through, as I find solace
              and joy in petting and caring for them
            </p>
